# Introduction

## Okay, so you like videos and feel a little guilty when you discover you've wasted three hours on YouTube watching 80's hair bands...

## What if that time gazing at videos wasn't wasted? What if there were an unlimited amount of videos in one place, about one thing... the thing you love!

## No! Not that! I'm talking about a ton of tech videos for tech geeks like us. It's not wasted time if you're learning something.

## So get ready to post your favorite tech videos, watch other tech videos posted by other tech video nerds, and together we can satisfy our video cravings and get a little smarter.

# Synopsis

As of April 30, 2017 the application is in an acceptable state for presentation as an MVP.

The application, in this state, would be an admin interface with full CRUD functionality.

Things that need to be addressed and polished are below:

* Tighter styling.
* Experiment with a different font-family.
* User testing.
* Security for users and the back-end.
* How to incorporate social media apart from the social media options already provided by the videos.
