  <p>Welcome to fave.tech(talk) where you can upload your favorite technical talk video or manuscript and generate discussion and further exploration of your favorite technical topics.
  </p>
  <p>The inspiration for this site came from a basic google search, "learn the concepts behind coding" which lead me to this page: <a href="http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/05/19/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-think/">Don't learn to code. Learn to think.</a>
  </p>
  <p>I read the post and then at the bottom of the page I saw a link for the next post: <a herf="http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/05/29/must-see-tech-talks-for-every-programmer/">Must-See Tech Talks for Every Programmer</a>.
  </p>
  <p>There are so many great videos on this list. The first one I watched was <i>Simple Made Easy</i> by Rich Hickey, the creator of <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Wow! The first thing I related his talk to was the very framework I was using to create this MVP with: <a href="https://www.emberjs.com/">Ember</a>. This is not a knock on Ember but it dawned on me that for the sake of "easy" I was giviing up "simple" and creating an architecture that was filled with dependencies and cross references. I am complecting my data, my code, and it is interfering with my ability to conceptualize what I am building.
  </p>
  <p>I hope these videos will put a few new thoughts in your head and help you create a mental space in which you can conceptualize your data and its dependencies.
